# React Assessment Project

## Overview

This project is a single-page application built with React that demonstrates proficiency in frontend development and understanding of full-stack concepts. The application features user authentication, data fetching from an API, and dynamic content rendering.

## Features

- **Modern React Setup**: Built with React 18, TypeScript, and Vite for optimal development experience
- **User Authentication**: Secure login functionality with token-based authentication
- **API Integration**: Efficient data fetching with React Query and Axios
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using modern CSS techniques with styled-components
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized project structure with separation of concerns
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time content updates based on user interactions

## Tech Stack

- **React 18**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast, modern build tool
- **Styled Components**: Component-based styling with theme support
- **React Router v6**: For application routing
- **React Query**: For efficient data fetching and caching
- **Axios**: For API requests
